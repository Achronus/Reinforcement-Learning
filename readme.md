# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

RL is a subfield of Machine Learning (ML) that is a type of Sequential Decision Making, which focuses on agents (AI) taking actions in an environment where they receive rewards as feedback.

This repository is my own personal guide to RL and contains knowledge from a variety of courses, blog posts, books and research papers that I have encountered that have been useful to me on my journey to becoming a Reinforcement Learning Engineer. A detailed list of these links can be found at the bottom of this page under [references](#References).

## Table of Contents

This section provides useful links to different components of RL, which are split into multiple subsections that link to wiki pages within the repository, providing unique information for each section.
